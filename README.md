# [Ulearn](https://ulearn.me/)

*Ulearn.me* — a platform with interactive online courses, which was made in [Kontour](https://kontur.ru/career).

This repository contains solutions to some of the tasks of the educational platform that I found most interesting.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Please **DO NOT** look at the solutions until you have solved a task, or at least spent some time
thinking about your own approaches to solving the challenge.
This approach will allow you to get the most benefit from the [courses](https://ulearn.me/).
